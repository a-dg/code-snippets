# CodeBox snippets

These are code snippets provided in a [CodeBox](http://www.shpakovski.com/codebox/) library file. CodeBox offers excellent organization and searchability. Raw source files are also provided, albeit in a flat list, because I mean come on.

Many of the snippets rely on each other, and may have similar names to indicate their relationship. Snippets with multiple components are stored in the same snippet in CodeBox.
